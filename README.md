# Colour Chess

This is a new project where I aim to create a chess modification/hack which incorporates additional colours into the game.

## Why?

* Provides beginners with a learning resource to know which squares they control and the best time to trade pieces.
* Gives a whole new perspective to the game for even master chess players.
* Arguably makes the game better for neurodivergent players who may perceive the game as more vivid and exciting.
